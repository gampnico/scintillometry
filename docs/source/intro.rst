Package Overview
================

This project initially formed part of a scintillometry field course. Due to licensing constraints, some dependencies are not satisfied by this package alone. These are indicated below.

1. Features (Roadmap)
---------------------

1.1 Scintillometry
------------------

- Parses scintillometry data from Scintec's BLS series of large aperture scintillometers.
- Processes this data and computes sensible heat fluxes.
- Processes topographical data.
- Processes InnFlux and HATPRO data.
- Produces plots of scintillometer data, path topography, and weather data.

1.2 Footprint Climatology
-------------------------

- Processes 2D flux footprints generated by Natascha Kljun's online model, available here_.

.. _here: http://footprint.kljun.net/

- Makes individual topographical adjustments and stitches footprints together.
- Overlays stitched footprints onto map.

2. Workflow
-----------

Not all data and dependencies are available via this package, and some modules must be tailored to each individual project, notably topography, station parameters and the times when the boundary layer switches from stable to unstable regimes.

If you are using a scintillometer in Austria, use `DGM 5m data`_ to generate topographical data for the scintillometer's path coordinates. Then generate the path transects, which are also necessary for calibrating the scintillometer.

.. _`DGM 5m data`: https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/digitales-gelandemodell-des-landes-salzburg-5m

If you are not using the scintillometer in Austria, you will need to find and parse topographical data yourself.

**Scintillometer path coordinates must be accurate. Incorrectly generated topographical data leads to poor calibration and nonsense results!**

This project would not be possible without the invaluable contributions from Josef Zink, Dr. Manuela Lehner, and Dr. Helen Ward.
